# Decision Queue

Two kinds of entry (see [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md) § Authority, raised 2026-08-15):

- **`your_call`** — genuinely needs Petter: money beyond the weekly limit,
  anything that legally binds the company, one-way public acts, pricing outside
  the existing band. **Saying nothing is never a yes.**
- **`decided`** — I made the call and did it. Listed so it is visible and can be
  reversed, not so it can be approved.

Technical questions never appear here. Each entry's first line is plain English,
because that line is what shows on the dashboard; the `*Label:*` fields below it
fill the expanded panel.

## OPEN

**DQ-3** · `your_call` · owner Petter · raised 2026-08-15T10:00Z · no deadline
Mexico needs an access key that only a person can sign up for. Would you register?
*What this is:* The Mexican business register (INEGI) hands out access keys through
a signup form. Creating accounts is one of the few things I don't do — the account
would be in your company's name and I shouldn't enter into that on your behalf.
*What I need:* Ten minutes on the INEGI site, then drop the key into the
environment settings. I'll do the rest.
*If you do nothing:* Mexican company lookups stay off the menu. Nothing else is
affected — no other work depends on this.
*Worth it?* Mexico is a large market but no customer has asked for it yet. Low
urgency. I'd do it when you happen to have a spare ten minutes, not before.

## DECIDED — visible so you can reverse them

**DQ-1** · `decided` · owner Claude · 2026-08-15
Taking the Italian company-lookup service to completion myself.
*What this is:* A service that looks up who owns and runs an Italian company.
It was built but never switched on, partly because I'd flagged the decision to you.
*Why it is mine:* Under the raised bar, switching a service on or off is my call —
it is reversible in one step, costs nothing new, and the judgement involved is
technical.
*What I will do:* Re-check the privacy clean-up (an earlier pass left real personal
ID numbers in a file the automatic check doesn't read), get it verified, then switch
it on and tell you it's live.
*How you'd reverse it:* Tell me to switch it off. It takes a minute.

**DQ-2** · `decided` · owner Claude · 2026-08-15
Leaving the company-director names in the old test file, with a note explaining why.
*What this is:* Names of company directors sitting in an archived test file.
*Why it is fine:* They come from the German public company register, where they are
published by law, and returning exactly this information is the whole purpose of our
German lookup service. Deleting them would suggest we think publishing them is a
problem, which would be odd while we sell them.
*Why I decided it:* I flagged it to you as a privacy judgement, but it isn't a legal
question — it's a question about whether our own product output is acceptable in our
own files, and the answer is plainly yes.
*How you'd reverse it:* Say the word and I'll delete the file.

**DQ-4** · `decided` · owner Claude · 2026-08-15
Switched off the US court-records lookup — its access key had expired and it was
returning errors to anyone who tried it. No customer had used it in a month.
*How you'd reverse it:* Get a fresh key from CourtListener and I'll switch it back on.

**DQ-5** · closed 2026-08-15 — filed here by mistake. It was a task, not a decision.
